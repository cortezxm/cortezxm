## Professional Summary
I’m currently working on my degree, machine learning projects. My focus areas include **machine learning**, **audio signal processing**, and **computer vision**. I believe in results, whether it’s reducing error rates in a neural network or improving my personal best time on a 5K run.

## Projects
- **Music Genre Classification**: Think you can tell the difference between rock and pop? Well, I taught a machine to do that. Using **CNNs**, and **MLP**, this project classifies music genres with the precision of a metronome. Inspired by **Valerio Velardo - The Sound of AI**.

- **Lie Detection Using Facial Recognition**: Ever wondered if someone’s lying to you? This project won’t help with that, but it does analyze **court trial videos** using **InceptionV3** and **LSTM** to detect deception. It’s all about the subtle facial cues—like when someone says they "only skipped leg day once." Dataset courtesy of the **University of Michigan's Real-Life Deception Detection** project.

## Skills
- **Machine Learning**: If it can be modeled, I’ve probably done it. And if not, I’m working on it.
- **Audio Signal Processing**: Why listen to music when you can teach a machine to *understand* it? 
- **Computer Vision**: Sure, I can see faces, but I’ve trained machines to see them *better*.
- **Sports Analytics**: Data doesn’t lie, unlike some players on the field. I analyze and use numbers to predict and enhance performance.

## Current Focus
- Training both my models and myself (life’s about balance, right?).

## Skills & Tools
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, SQL
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Librosa
- **Tech**: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, Computer Vision, Audio Processing
- **Tools**: Git, Docker, Jupyter Notebooks, and maybe a pair of boxing gloves
